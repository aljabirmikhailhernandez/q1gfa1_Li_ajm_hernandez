                Tell me something<br>
                When the rain falls on my face<br>
                How do you quickly replace it  <br>
                With a golden summer smile?<br>
                Tell me something<br>
                When I'm feelin' tired and afraid<br>
                How do you know just what to say<br>
                To make everything alright?<br>
                I don't think that you even realize<br>
                The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe<br>
                You hold me like I'm the one who's precious<br>
                I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around<br>
                You can thank your stars all you want<br>
                But I'll always be the lucky one<br>
                Tell me something<br>
                When I'm 'bout to lose control<br>
                How do you patiently hold my hand<br>
                And gently calm me down?<br>
                Tell me something<br>
                When you sing and when you laugh<br>
                Why do I always photograph<br>
                My heart flying way above the clouds?<br>
                I don't think that you even realize<br>
                The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe<br>
                You hold me like I'm the one who's precious<br>
                I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around<br>
                You can thank your stars all you want<br>
                But I'll always be the lucky one<br>
                Whoa-oh-ooh, ooh<br>
                Whoa-oh-ooh, oohv<br>
                Whoa-oh-ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
                I don't think that you even realize<br>
                The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe<br>
                You hold me like I'm the one who's precious<br>
                I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around<br>
                You can thank your stars all you want<br>
                But I'll always be the lucky one<br>
                You can thank your stars all you want<br>
                But I'll always be the lucky one<br>
                I'll always be the lucky one<br>
                I'll always be the lucky one <br>
